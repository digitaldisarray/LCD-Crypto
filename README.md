# LCD-Crypto
:heavy_dollar_sign: A live crypto currency tracker that outputs to an arduino controlled lcd screen.

How it works:
A program is run on a computer that sends data to the arduino.
The arduino then updates the cost of whatever crypto that you want that is on the lcd screen.

TODO:
 - Make it.
 - Make it better.
 - Add a python version.
 - Make it even better than before.
 
## Why?
Keeping track of crypto is fun.
